          <p>I love helping businesses succeed. I get a huge amount of satisfaction from knowing that through a solution I was a part of a business was able to become more efficient, become more cost effective, meet their client's requirements, or do something they weren't able to do otherwise.</p>
          <p>The way I work with my customers is based on excellent communication, honesty, setting realistic expectations, and a drive to succeed.</p>
          <p>I'm great at listening to a customer's problem or idea and, with them, creating a custom solution <span class="font-bold italic">for them</span> rather than using some off-the-shelf solution that doesn't meet all of their needs.</p>
          <p>Since a lot of my work has been either protected by an NDA or is behind a corporate firewall, <router-link class="link font-bold pb-px" to="work">here</router-link> are a few high-level explanations of the work I've done.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, you can get in touch <a class="link font-bold pb-px" href="https://sc-techservices.com/contact-us/">through my company</a> or <a class="link font-bold pb-px" href="https://twitter.com/ianhilt">@ianhilt</a>.</p>
